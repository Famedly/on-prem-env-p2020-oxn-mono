# lego - Let's Encrypt client written in Go. 
Project Info: https://github.com/go-acme/lego

## Usage
### Installation
The role checks whether lego is installed and if the installed version (`lego_version`) is the desired one.

If `lego` needs to be installed on the target machine, the specified release will be downloaded from GitHub and installed to the working directory (usually `lego_base_path: /opt/lego`).

To download and install the executable information about the system architecture needs to be supplied, the defaults are: `lego_system_type: "linux" lego_system_arch: "amd64"`.
By default, the executable will get the capability to bind to ports below 1024. This behavior can be controlled with `lego_cap_net_bind_service`.

A `systemd` unit and timer will be created containing the lego configuration parameters. The timer is run every 15min, this can be changed using `lego_timer_on_boot: "5min"` and `lego_timer_on_calendar: "*:0/15"`

To run `lego` as an unprivileged user, a user called `lego` (`lego_user`) is created and used by systemd to run lego periodically.

### Request a certificate
#### Certificate
Pass `lego_certificate` to the role the data should look something like this:
```yml
lego_certificate:
  domains:
    - "example.domain"
    - "*.example.domain"
    - "another.example.domain"
  email: "admins@example.domain"
```
** Keep in mind that wildcard certificates (`*.example.domain`) can usually only be requested using a dns challenge. **
#### Let's encrypt environment
By default the Let's encrypt **staging** environment is used. To prevent hitting ratelimits during testing.
You can switch to the production environment with the `lego_letsencrypt_environment` variable:
```yml
lego_letsencrypt_environment: staging   #Staging environment (default)
lego_letsencrypt_environment: prod      #Production environment
```
#### Challenge
You can choose between `http`, `tls` and `dns` challenge types:
##### http (used by default)
```yml
lego_challenge:
  type: http
```

##### tls
```yml
lego_challenge:
  type: tls
```

##### DNS
When using a dns based challenge you have to supply your dns-provider (`cloudflare` for example). A list of supported providers can be found here [https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/).
```yml
lego_challenge:
  type: dns
  provider: my-dns-provider
```
Usually you have to pass additional configuration parameters to use a dns challenge, this is usually done using environment variables:
```yml
lego_configuration:
  environment:
    CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN: "supersecrettoken"
```
Which variables you need depends on your dns provider and is documented in the lego documentation.

## Additional configuration
### Environment variables and Parameters
You can customise all parameters and environment variables passed to lego during role execution and systemd execution using `lego_configuration`:

**Usually you don't have to change any `command_parameters`**

Lego has 4 (in normal operation only `run` and `renew` are used) commands, they share `global` parameters and each have their own additional parameters:
```yml
lego_configuration:
  command_parameters:
    global: 
      parameter: value
    run:
      parameter: value
    renew:
      parameter: value
  environment: 
    VARIABLE: VALUE
```
Parameters are automatically prefixed with `--` and passed to lego. Environment variables are treated as global options and passed every time.

Documentation on the parameters can be found here: [https://go-acme.github.io/lego/usage/cli/](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/usage/cli/)

**Keep in mind that the passed configuration will be merged with the generated / default configuration from above**

### Tasks
This role differentiates between 2 tasks:
- Playbook
  Is executed during the ansible run (only executed when the configuration changes or the initial installation ). It uses the `lego` command `run`: An acme-account is created and a certificate is requested.
- Systemd
  Is executed periodically by systemd, using the `renew` command: The validity of the certificate is checked, if it will expire soon (less than 30 days) a new certificate is requested.

### Hooks
You can request lego to run hooks after certain events. You can add those using `lego_configuration`. More info on hooks can be found here: [https://go-acme.github.io/lego/usage/cli/examples/#to-renew-the-certificate-and-hook](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/usage/cli/examples/) 

### Use an existing acme account
To use an existing acme account you have to pass its account uri and the private key like this:

**You MUST use a PEM-encoded private key:**
It must be wrapped with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
```yml
lego_acme_privkey: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MYSUPERSECRETPRIVATEKEY
  MYSUPERSECRETPRIVATEKEY
  MYSUPERSECRETPRIVATEKEY
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

lego_acme_account:
  registration:
    uri: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/my-account-id"
```
